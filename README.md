# NFT Market Analysis - Group 4

## Project Overview

### Analyzing data from the US Stock Market, NFT Marketplace, and Crypto Market to identify data driven trends in the NFT market

## Research Questions:

### Broader Market Analysis

* Compare Volume of ETFs vs ETH based dataset (Opensea data, ETH pricing, ETH Gas cost) 

* Compare Prices of ETH and ETH Gas Prices over time

### NFT Market Analysis

* Determine who the buyers of specific NFTs are and if there are a few wallets holding the majority of available assets 

* What are the price trends for specific NFT collections?

* What are the entry points for these collections?

* How has the price changed over time for these collections?

* What are some of the returns on each of the NFT collections?

* How has ETH gas prices impacted volume of these NFT collections?

# Conclusions - What did the data tell us?

- Gas Price was not a factor in individuals purchasing within the explored NFT datasets. Our group had initially thought NFT volume would negatively correlate with ETH gas prices. Conclusion here is that individuals will buy what they want, when they want.
